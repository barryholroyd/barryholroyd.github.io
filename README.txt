This is my GitHub home page.

You can put temporary files in ./tmp and access them directly, e.g., to try out a new APK:

	File: ./tmp/app-free-release.apk
	URL:  http://barryholroyd.github.io/tmp/app-free-release.apk

After a page is pushed, it typically takes a few minutes for the change
to appear on the web site. You can just click on the refresh button
occasionally until the change appears.
