          <H2>Summary</H2>
	  I have accumulated more than seven years of contracting work over
	  the course of my career, completing dozens of projects for a
	  range of satistified clients.
          <p>
            I believe that anything I produce should be fully extensible and
	    maintainable by others, even in my absence. To achieve this goal,
	    I ensure that the projects I produce are not only well
	    architected and implemented, but also thoroughly documented.
            <H3>Galatia</H3>
	    In 1995 I founded Galatia, a web application development firm. As
	    CEO, over course of five years I grew it from scratch to 20 full
	    time employees and produced projects for almost 100 clients,
	    including:
	    <blockquote>
              AEA Credit Union, Agilent, Cisco, CNET, EPRI, Irwin Home
	      Equity, Neoforma, San Francisco Examiner, San Jose State
	      University, SOFTBANK, Stanford, UCLA, United Way,
	    </blockquote>
          <p>
            As CTO, I was the lead architect and developer for many of the
	    projects.
            <H3>Green Light Immersion</H3>
	    As the principal of Green Light Immersion (the business name of
	    the company under which I do my personal consulting), I
	    consulted for Real Life Plus (architecture, development and
	    refactoring of their online game) and Heartwood (hands-on
	    development and contributions to proposals for aerospace, Dod
	    and FBI RFPs).
          <H2>Customer Satisfaction</H2>
	  Eu-Ming Lee, CTO of Real Life Plus:
          <blockquote>
            Although Barry has an impressive resume of managerial experience,
	    that is not what we at RealLifePlus hired him for. We needed
	    someone to get into the tangled mess that was our networking
	    system and straighten it all out. We needed someone to get their
	    hands dirty and sort out what was what from so many undocumented
	    scripts, files, directories and programs spread across several
	    servers and several languages, including C# in Unity3D,
	    JavaScript, and PHP. In addition, there were various protocols,
	    middleware and custom hacks that punctuated this mess through the
	    so-called "system".
            <p>
              Barry was able to make sense of it all, which requires not only
	      familiarity and expertise with an extremely broad base of
	      knowledge, but requires wisdom and architectural instinct that
	      can only be honed through many projects and years of experience
	      with practical software development.
              <p>
                When he was done, Barry delivered expert documentation of the
		newly reorganized system as well as a new architecture for
		the system that allowed ease of debugging and ease of
		comprehension of the entire system. If you look at the new
		system Barry provided, you could not point to anything
		remarkable about it except its simplicity. Only in contrast
		with what was there before do you appreciate the unremarkable
		simplicity of Barry's work. Only through years of experience
		can someone like Barry deliver what you really want and what
		you really need now and going into the future.
                <p>
                  Being able to understand what your technical needs are now
		  and in the future is what separates Barry from less
		  experienced developers. You will save time and money if you
		  just let Barry do things right in the first place.
