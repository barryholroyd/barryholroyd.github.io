	    <hr>
            I am a seasoned engineer with extensive experience both as a
	    hands-on developer (e.g., as a Principal Architect at Oracle and
	    an Android Staff Engineer at Quora) and as a manager (multiple
	    roles as a Director or VP of engineering, in charge of teams
	    ranging in size from one to 60).
	    <p>
	    I believe that a deep understanding of current technologies is
	    critical for a good engineering leader. Maintaining such
	    knowledge over time is difficult, given the pace of change and
	    the range of duties involved.
	    <p>
	    In early 2015, I decided to take some significant time off and
	    devote myself 100% to refreshing my technical skills. After
	    careful consideration, I chose Android as my area of expertise.
	    <p>
	    I completed my studies in 2017 and accepted a position as a
	    staff engineer on the Android development team at Quora. I was
	    one of two engineers working on the app. It has been downloaded
	    by over 10,000,000 users and is rated 4.5 in the Play Store.
	    <p>
	    I am now looking for my next position. My strongest interest
	    is in hands-on development with a focus on architecture and/or
	    refactoring -- I like a good, clean system and am willing to
	    work hard to create one. I would also be interested in a
	    management position, as long as it afforded me enough time to
	    stay technically current.
	    <p>
	    Detailed information regarding my experience can be found at the
	    following links.

	    In addition to my work on the Quora Android app, I produced
	    numerous personal apps over the course of my studies. The following
	    apps are of particular interest.

	          <i>Evermore</i> is an extensive,
	          map-based travel planning application which provides a visual
	          integration of search technologies. Multiple searches using
	          multiple search engines can be applied across multiple areas,
	          with all the results being displayed simultaneously on a
	          single map.
	          <p>
	          The implementation consists of 150 Java files with 16,000 lines
	          of handwritten code.
	          <p>
		  Note: the search functionality is currently unavailable because
		  of Yelp's API upgrades.

	          <i>Bluetooth Chat Technical Demo</i> is a technical
		  demonstration of a Bluetooth 3.0 ("Classic") implementation
		  of a chat application. Basic functionality includes
		  optional Bluetooth discovery, Bluetooth pairing, basic
		  connect/disconnect and, of course chat functionality. It
		  also fully handles all of the edge cases that plague many
		  such implementations (e.g., loss of connection on device
		  rotation, memory and thread leaks, etc.).
