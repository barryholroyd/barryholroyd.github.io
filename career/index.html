              <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
	    </center>
	    <hr>
            I am a seasoned engineer with extensive experience both as a
	    hands-on developer (e.g., as a Principal Architect at Oracle) and
	    as a manager (multiple roles as a Director or VP of engineering,
	    in charge of teams ranging in size from one to 60).
	    <p>
	    I believe that a deep understanding of current technologies is
	    critical for a good engineering leader. Maintaining such
	    knowledge over time is difficult, given the pace of change and
	    the range of duties involved.
	    <p>
	    In early 2015, I decided to take some significant time off and
	    devote myself 100% to refreshing my technical skills. After
	    careful consideration, I chose Android as my area of expertise. I
	    have now completed my studies and have a very solid understanding
	    of Android and its surrounding technologies (IDEs, Java, Groovy,
	    Gradle, etc.).
	    <p>
	    This period of study has been both entertaining and rewarding.  I
	    am now looking for an interesting and challenging project that
	    can benefit from my unusual combination of management and hands-on
	    skills. I am interested in a wide range of activities and
	    responsibilities -- everything from a strictly hands-on
	    development position up through a Director-level management
	    position, as long as Android is involved.
	    <p>
	    Detailed information regarding my experience can be found at the
	    following links.

	    I have produced numerous Android apps (in addition to dozens of
	    Java apps, Groovy scripts and Gradle build scripts) over the
	    course of my studies. A select list of my more interesting apps
	    is available at
	    <a href="http://barryholroyd.com/android/apps">Android Apps</a>.
	    The following three apps are of particular interest.

	          <i>Evermore</i> is my showcase app. Evermore is an extensive,

	          multiple search engines can be applied across multiple areas,

	          single map.
	          <p>
	          The implementation consists of 150 Java files with 16,000 lines
	          of handwritten code.

	          <i>Bluetooth Chat Technical Demo</i> is a technical
		  demonstration of a Bluetooth 3.0 ("Classic") implementation
		  of a chat application. Basic functionality includes
		  optional Bluetooth discovery, Bluetooth pairing, basic
		  connect/disconnect and, of course chat functionality. It
		  also fully handles all of the edge cases that plague many
		  such implementations (e.g., loss of connection on device
		  rotation, memory and thread leaks, etc.).
