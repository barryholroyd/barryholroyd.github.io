	    <hr>
            I am a seasoned engineer with extensive experience both as a
	    hands-on developer (e.g., as an Android Staff Engineer at Quora
	    and a Principal Architect at Oracle) and as a manager (multiple
	    roles as a Director or VP of engineering, in charge of teams
	    ranging in size from one to 60).
	    <p>
	    I believe that a deep understanding of current technologies is
	    critical for a good engineering leader. Maintaining such
	    knowledge over time is difficult, given the pace of change and
	    the range of duties involved.
	    <p>
	    In early 2015, I decided to take some significant time off and
	    devote myself 100% to refreshing my technical skills. After
	    careful consideration, I chose Android as my area of expertise.
	    <p>
	    I completed my studies in 2017 and accepted a position as a
	    staff engineer on the Android development team at Quora. I was
	    one of two engineers working on the app. It has been downloaded
	    by over 10,000,000 users and is rated 4.5 in the Play Store.
	    <p>
	    I am now looking for my next position. I am targeting
	    Android-related work, either as an individual contributor or as a
	    manager/director, somewhere in the South Bay or mid-peninsula (I
	    live in Mountain View and would like to limit my one-way commute
	    to about a half hour).
	    <p>
	    I deeply enjoy hands-on development, with a focus on architecture
	    and/or refactoring -- I like a good, clean system and am willing
	    to work hard to create one. I would also be interested in a
	    management position, as long as it afforded me enough time to
	    stay technically current.
	    <p>
	    Detailed information regarding my experience can be found at the
	    following links.
