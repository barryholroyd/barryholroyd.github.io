	    <hr>
            I am a seasoned engineer with extensive experience both as a
	    hands-on developer (e.g., as an Android Staff Engineer at Quora
	    and a Principal Architect at Oracle) and as a manager (multiple
	    roles as a Director or VP of engineering, in charge of teams
	    ranging in size from one to 60).
	    <p>
	    I believe that a deep understanding of current technologies is
	    critical for a good engineering leader. Maintaining such
	    knowledge over time is difficult, given the pace of change and
	    the range of duties involved.
	    <p>
	    In early 2015, I decided to take some significant time off and
	    devote myself 100% to refreshing my technical skills. After
	    careful consideration, I chose Android as my area of expertise.
	    <p>
	    I completed my studies in 2017 and accepted a position as a
	    staff engineer on the Android development team at Quora, followed
	    by a position at Google managing the Google Play Services team.
	    <p>
	    Detailed information regarding my experience can be found at the
	    following links.
