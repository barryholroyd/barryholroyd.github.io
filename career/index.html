        <TR>
	  <TD>
            I am a seasoned engineer with extensive experience both as a
	    hands-on developer (e.g., as a Principal Architect at Oracle) and
	    as a manager (multiple roles as a Director or VP of engineering,
	    in charge of teams ranging in size from one to 60).
	    <p>
	    Please see my <a href="http://barryholroyd.com/resume">Resume</a>
	    or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/barryholroyd">LinkedIn</a>
	    profile for more information.
	    <p>
	    I am currently in pursuit of my next position. My best fit is
	    probably as a technical manager, but I'm interested in anything
	    Android-related: full time or consulting, management or hands-on.

          <TH>Android</TH>
        <TR>

            In 2015 I decided to specialize in Android. I devoted the entire year
  	    to studying virtually all aspects of Android and the tools supporting
  	    it. During that stretch, I produced a handful of interesting Android
	    apps. A full list, including APKs, source code and documentation for
	    each, is available at 
	    <a href="http://barryholroyd.com/android/apps">Android Apps</a>.
	    <p>
	    By far, the most challenging and significant of my apps is
	    <a href="http://barryholroyd.com/evermore">Evermore</a>.
	    Evermore is a visually
  	    based, robust integration of search technologies. The implementation
	    consists of 150 Java files with 16,000 lines of handwritten code.
	    <p>
	    Evermore is available in the Google Play Store. Extensive
	    documentation, including a FAQ, a full reference section and a
	    number of simple tutorials, is available as <i>Help</i> from the app
	    or directly from the web site. Source code and detailed documentation
	    regarding its architecture is also available.
