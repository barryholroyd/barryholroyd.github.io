            <H2>Who Am I?</H2>
            I am a seasoned engineer with extensive experience both as a
	    hands-on developer (e.g., as a Principal Architect at Oracle) and
	    as a manager (multiple roles as a Director or VP of engineering,
	    in charge of teams ranging in size from one to 60).
	    <p>
	    I believe that a deep understanding of current technologies is
	    critical for a good engineering leader. Maintaining such
	    knowledge over time is difficult, given the pace of change and
	    the range of duties involved.
	    <p>
	    In early 2015, I decided to take some significant time off and
	    devote myself 100% to refreshing my technical skills. After
	    careful consideration, I chose Android as my area of expertise. I
	    have now completed my studies and have a very solid understanding
	    of Android and its surrounding technologies (IDEs, Java, Groovy,
	    Gradle, etc.).
	    <p>
	    This period of study has been both entertaining and rewarding.  I
	    am now looking for an interesting and challenging project that
	    can benefit from my unusual combination of management and hands-on
	    skills. I am interested in a wide range of activities and
	    responsibilities -- everything from a strictly hands-on
	    development position up through a Director-level management
	    position, as long as Android is involved.
	    <p>
	    Detailed information regarding my experience can be found at the
	    following links.

	    I have produced numerous Android apps (in addition to dozens of
	    Java apps, Groovy scripts and Gradle build scripts) over the course
	    of my studies. A full list of the Android apps, including APKs,
	    source code and documentation for each, is available at 
	    <a href="http://barryholroyd.com/android/apps">Android Apps</a>.
	    However, the following two apps are of special interest.

              <H3>Evermore</H3>
	      Evermore is my showcase app. Evermore is an extensive,
	      map-based travel planning application which provides a visual
	      integration of search technologies. Multiple searches using
	      multiple search engines can be applied across multiple areas,
	      with all the results being displayed simultaneously on a
	      single map. An alternate "list" view shows each individual
	      search result with relevant information displayed: an arrow
	      pointing in the physical direction of the result, the distance
	      to the result, etc. -- all dynamically updated.
	    <p>
	      The implementation consists of 150 Java files with 16,000 lines
	      of handwritten code.
	    <p>
	      Evermore is available in the Google Play Store. Extensive
	      documentation, including a FAQ, a full reference section and
	      several simple tutorials, is available as <i>Help</i> from
	      the app or directly from the web site. Source code and detailed
	      documentation regarding its architecture is also available.

	      <H3>Product List High Performance Demo</a></H3>
	      ProdListHpDemo is a well-documented, well-written technical
	      demonstration of a high performance "list" implementation. I
	      recommend this code base to anyone who would like to get a feel
	      for the quality of code that I write in a professional
	      capacity. In addition to being well designed and well
	      documented, it provides the following performance-related
	      features.
		<ol>
		  <li> Images downloaded in the background. Two
		       implementations are provided: AsyncTask-based and
		       threads-based.
		  <li> Initial image url retained as a field and compared to
		       the (potentially updated) URL of the ViewHolder upon
		       image arrival.
		  <li> Configurable look-ahead pre-loading.
		  <li> Configurable memory cache.
		  <li> Configurable disk cache.
		</ol>
	      There are numerous cache configuration settings available so
	      that you can see the effects of the caches in use.
	      <p>
	      As this is a technical demo its user-facing functionality is
	      small (a simple list of products pulled from Walmart via the
	      Walmart Open API along with a separate screen to display
	      individual products). Relatively little attention was paid
	      to the user interface.
