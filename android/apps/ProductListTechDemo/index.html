            <i>Product List Technical Demo</i> is a technical demonstration of
	    a high performance "list" implementation.
	    <ul>
	      <li>Two implementations are provided: AsyncTask-based and
		  threads-based.
              <li>All images are downloaded in the background. Configurable
	          look-ahead pre-loading of images is used to minimize delay.
              <li>Each initial image url is retained as a field and compared
	          to the (potentially updated) URL of the ViewHolder upon
		  image arrival. Images which arrive too late are dropped
		  for the original request but cached for later use.
              <li>A fully configurable memory cache is included.
              <li>A fully configurable disk cache is included.
	    </ul>
	    <p>
            There are numerous cache configuration settings available under
	    <i>Settings</i> so that you can see the effects of the caches in
	    use.
	    <p>
            As this is a technical demo its user-facing functionality is
	    small (a simple list of products pulled from Walmart via the
	    Walmart Open API, along with a separate screen to display
	    individual products).
