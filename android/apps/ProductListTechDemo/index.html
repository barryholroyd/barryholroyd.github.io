            ProdListHpDemo is a well-documented, well-written technical
	    demonstration of a high performance "list" implementation.
	    <p>
	    <ul>
              <li>Images downloaded in the background. Two implementations are
	          provided: AsyncTask-based and threads-based.
              <li>Initial image url retained as a field and compared to the
	          (potentially updated) URL of the ViewHolder upon image arrival.
              <li>Configurable look-ahead pre-loading.
              <li>Configurable memory cache.
              <li>Configurable disk cache.
	    </ul>
	    <p>
        There are numerous cache configuration settings available so that you
	can see the effects of the caches in use.
	    <p>
        As this is a technical demo its user-facing functionality is small (a
	simple list of products pulled from Walmart via the Walmart Open API
	along with a separate screen to display individual products).
	Relatively little attention was paid to the user interface
