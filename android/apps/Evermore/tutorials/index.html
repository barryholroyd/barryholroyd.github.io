	      are from your desired location(s) and in which directions.
	      The translucent radius around each <i>Target</i> helps you easily

	      to find friends in the area and to find interesting
	      restaurants, activities and services that are, <i>as a

	      (such as Yelp, Google Maps and your local Contacts), Evermore
	      also makes it easy to contact anyone you need to and/or get
	      relevant directions.

	      Evermore can help you find all the good restaurants <i>and</i>
	      gas stations near the freeway <i>and display all the results on a

	      restaurants and gas stations are ahead of you (green arrows),
	      near you (yellow arrows), or behind you (red arrows), as well
	      as their distances and direction from your current location.
	      The List screen is updated in real time, so you can sit back
	      and drive without making any decisions until you come upon a
	      particularly interesting restaurant with a nearby gas station.

	      Trax light rail from the airport to downtown Salt Lake City,
	      where you can get off at the Gallivan Station. However, it
	      isn't clear if you can comfortably walk to your hotel from the
	      station, especially with all of your luggage. It would also be
	      nice to know if you can walk from your hotel to the Convention
	      Center, where the tournament is.  </td>
