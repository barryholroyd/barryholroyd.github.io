# Overview
Evermore is designed to be map-centric. Using it is a two-step process.

1. Select one or more locations. This can be done by tapping on the map, providing an address or selecting from your device's contacts. The resulting locations are represented on the map by colored pins called _Targets_. The translucent circle that appears around the _Target_ represents the radius of the searches to be done.
2. Run one or more searches. Searches are done by using the buttons on the left side of Evermore. Yelp searches or a search through the device's contacts can be done. The search results are represented on the map by colored pins called _Darts_.

The standard map movement functions work (e.g., press, hold and move to pan
the map, double finger pinch to zoom in/out, quick double-tap to zoom in,
press and rotate with two fingers to rotate the map, etc.).

# Simple Examples
## Display All Contacts
Simply long-press on the _Contacts_ button. Evermore will scan the Contacts in
your mobile device's address book and display a pin for each Contact it finds
that has either a Work or a Home address.
## Display Contacts and Mexican Restaurants
Tap on the map in several places in your local area. Then tap on _Contacts_
to display the people you know in the area. Then click on any one of the
_Search_ buttons and do a Yelp search for Mexican Restaurants (select _Restaurants_ from the category pull down and the _Mexican_ from the secondary pull down). Click on each
of the Mexican Restaurant _Darts_ to find out more about it. Click on a
_Contacts_ _Dart_ to call a friend.

# App Screens and Controls
## Main Screen
### App Bar
The App Bar is located at the very top of the screen. At the far left is the
title, _Evermore_. At the far right is the app's pull-down menu (see
[Menu](#menu), below). In the center are three radio buttons: Main, Map and
List. These three buttons allow you to switch between the [Main
Screen](main-screen), the [Map Screen](map-screen) and the [List
Screen](list-screen).
### The Left Button Column
Tap on the map first to create one or more _Targets_. Then do one or more of the following.
* Contacts: Click on _Contacts_ to create Contact _Darts_ near the _Targets_.
  This will scan your mobile device's address
  book for Contacts with Home and/or Work addresses and display them on the
  map. You can long-click on the Contact button to display _all_ of your
  Contacts, even if there are no _Targets_ on the map.
* Search #: Click on one of the _Search_ buttons to create a _Dart_ for a
  Yelp search.
### The Map
The Map is the center piece of Evermore. You can add _Targets_ by simply tapping
on the map.

Once one or more _Targets_ are present, you can add _Darts_ by either
doing a _Contacts_ search (click on the _Contacts_ button) or doing one or
more Yelp searches (by clicking on the _Search_ buttons).

* Tap on an empty location to drop a _Target_ there.
* Tap on a _Target_ to see its title.
* Tap on a Contact _Dart_ to see Contact details, then click on the phone
  number or email address to phone or email the contact, respectively.
* Tap on a Yelp _Dart_ to see details of that particular Yelp search result.
* Tapping on any pin will cause two icons to be displayed in the lower left
  corner of the map. Clicking on the Blue Diamond will show you details of
  the selected location. Clicking on the small map icon will give you
  directions to the selected location.
* The standard map movement functions work (e.g., press, hold and move to pan
  the map, double finger pinch to zoom in/out, quick double-tap to zoom in,
  press and rotate with two fingers to rotate the map, etc.). Tapping on the
  small circle in the upper right corned will center the map on your current
  location.
### Bottom Button Bar
Home: Toggle the display of your Home icon. You must have specified your Home
address in the Settings.
Work: Toggle the display of your Work icon. You must have specified your Work
address in the Settings.
Radius: Turns the radius display on and off. The radii can be made monochrome
in the Settings at the top right.
Clear Map: This will clear all pins from the map, but will leave the Home and
Work icons, if present. This fully destroys the Targets and _Darts_
so that a fresh set of each can be created.
## Map Screen
This is a version of the Main screen which doesn't have any of the editing controls -- that maximizes the size of the map.
## List Screen
This displays all the _Darts_ in a list format.  The nearest _Darts_ will be
near the center of the list and the furthest _Darts_ will be at the top and
bottom of the list. By default, the top of the list represents North but if
you are moving then it will match the direction of your most recent movement.

Each row has the following, from left to right.

* An icon representing the type of the row (e.g., _Contact_, _Yelp Search_).
* Short description of the _Dart_.
* Line-of-sight distance to the represented _Dart_.
* Arrow pointing in the direction of the _Dart_.

Note that the distance provided is the _line-of-sight_ distance to the
_Dart_ and may not be the same as the driving distance to the _Dart_.

## Menu
* Settings
  * Addresses
    * Home Address: Your home address. Used to place the Home icon on the map.
    * Work Address: Your work address. Used to place the Work icon on the map.
  * Map
    * Map Type: Normal, Satellite, Terrain, Hybrid (Satellite and Terrain).
    * Display Traffic: Traffic overlay on/off.

  * Radius
    * Radius Distance: Search radius.
    * Radius Multicolor: If selected, each radius will be represented by
      a randomly selected color. If not selected, all radii will be a single
      color.
* Exit: Exit the app.

# Miscellaneous
## Contacts
Contacts get loaded the first time the app is run after installation.
While this is happening, a progress bar is displayed under the Contacts
button. Small messages indicating the start and end of the loading
process will also appear briefly at the bottom of the screen.

After this initial load, the Contacts will be silently refreshed each
time the app is started. Because this can take some time but typically
results in only a small change in the list of Contacts, if any, no
progress bar is shown.

The display of a Contact on the map in Evermore depends on the Contact
having a postal address (home and/or work) and that any such addresses
can be mapped to a latitude and longitude.

If an address is missing or mal-formed or if Google's Geocoder can't locate it,
then it won't be displayed on the map.

## Overlapping Searches
If there are multiple Targets on the map with overlapping radii, then a
search may have multiple Darts appear at the same location -- one for each of
the radii. This is by design. You have the option of clearing a search --
with this approach, an appropriate number of Darts will still be present
at each location.
