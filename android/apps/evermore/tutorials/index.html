	      The translucent radius around each <i>Target</i> helps you easily

	      (such as Yelp, Google Maps and your local Contacts), Evermore
	      also makes it easy to contact anyone you need to and/or get
	      relevant directions.

	      Evermore can help you find all the good restaurants <i>and</i>
	      gas stations near the freeway <i>and display all the results on a
	      single map</i>. You can use the List screen to easily see which
	      restaurants and gas stations are ahead of you (green arrows),
	      near you (yellow arrows), or behind you (red arrows), as well
	      as their distances and direction from your current location.
	      The List screen is updated in real time, so you can sit back
	      and drive without making any decisions until you come up on a
	      particularly interesting restaurant that has a gas station near
	      it.

          <td>Identify best bars and restaurants around multiple locations.</td>
          <td>This can be extremely useful on trips. For instance, if attending
	      a conference at the Salt Lake City Convention Center while
	      staying at the Residence Inn hotel a few blocks away, you might
	      want to identify the best bars and restaurants around each
	      location so that you can have a meal or a drink at either one, or
	      use the information to make plans.
	  This allows you to easily see where one location is relative to
	      another. For instance, when taking the local Trax light rail in
	      Salt Lake City from the airport to downtown, it is helpful to see
	      how far away your hotel is from the Trax station.
