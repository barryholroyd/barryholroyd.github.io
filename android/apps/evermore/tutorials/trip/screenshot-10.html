	Switch to List screen (use the radio button
	at the top of the screen) to see the Pins
	(search results) in a list format.
	<p>
	Green arrows point towards those ahead of us; yellow
	towards those just ahead or to the side of us; red
	arrows towards those behind us. Distances are also
	provided.
	<p>
	The list gets updated in real time, so you have the
	option of just sitting back as you drive and waiting
	for something interesting to scroll into view (click on
	<i>Lock</i> to lock the list to the yellow/red arrow
	boundary).
	<p>
	Click on <i>Faron's New Orleans BBQ</i> to bring up
	its Yelp page or get directions to it.
