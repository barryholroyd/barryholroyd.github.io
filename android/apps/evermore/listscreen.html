    This displays all the <i>Darts</i> in a list format.  The nearest
    <i>Darts</i> will be near the center of the list and the furthest
    <i>Darts</i> will be at the top and bottom of the list. By default, the
    top of the list represents North but if you are moving then it will match
    the direction of your most recent movement.
    <p>

    <ul>

      <li>Line-of-sight distance to the represented <i>Dart</i>.
      <li>Arrow pointing in the direction of the <i>Dart</i>.
    </ul>
    Note that the distance provided is the <i>line-of-sight</i> distance to the
    <i>Dart</i> and may not be the same as the driving distance to the <i>Dart</i>.
