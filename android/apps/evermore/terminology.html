          <dd>Targets appear as colored pins on the map. Each Target
	      represents a location on the map with a defined radius within
	      which subsequent searches will be done. Targets can be created
	      in several ways, e.g., by tapping on the map, using the
	      <i>Contacts List</i> button at the top of the screen or the
	      <i>Address Search</i> button next to it. In all cases, a pin of
	      a specific color appears at the Target's location on the map
	      and a translucent circle representing the search radius appears
	      around it (unless the radius visibility is turned off in
	      Settings).</dd>
          <dt id="Dart">Dart</dt>
          <dd>Darts appear as colored pins on the map. Each Dart represents
	      a search result. Tapping on a Dart will bring up a small
	      information window; tapping on that window will bring up more
	      information, much of it actionable.
          <dt id="Search">Search</dt>
          <dd>The term <i>Search</i> has a somewhat broad meaning in
	      Evermore. It includes all the functions provided by the buttons
	      in the left pane of the app -- e.g., Yelp searches initiated
	      via any of the Search buttons or a Contacts search through your
	      address book to find Contacts within the target areas you've
	      created.
          <dt id="Location">Location</dt>
          <dd>The current location of the device.</dd>
          <dt id="Bearing">Bearing</dt>
          <dd>The direction that the device is currently travelling. This is
	    <i>not</i> necessarily the direction that the device is facing.</dd>
