          <dt>Target</dt>
          <dd>Targets are markers on the map with a defined radius within which subsequent searches will be done. Targets can be created in several ways, e.g., by tapping on the map, using the <i>Contacts List</i> button at the top of the screen or the <i>Address Search</i> button next to it. In all cases, a pin of a specific color appears at the Target's location on the map and a translucent circle representing the search radius appears around it (unless the radius visibility is turned off in Settings).</dd>
          <dt>Dart</dt>
          <dd>Darts represent the results of searches. Every time a search is done, Darts appear at each location where there is a search result. Tapping on a Dart will bring up a small information window; tapping on that window will bring up more information, much of it actionable.
          <dt>Search</dt>
          <dd>The term <i>Search</i> has a somewhat broad meaning in Evermore. It includes all the functions provided by the buttons in the left pane of the app -- e.g., Yelp searches initiated via any of the Search buttons or a Contacts search through your address book to find Contacts within the Target areas you've created.
          <dt>Location</dt>
          <dd>The current location of the device.</dd>
          <dt>Bearing</dt>
          <dd>The direction that the device is currently travelling. This is <i>not</i> the direction that the device is facing.</dd>
