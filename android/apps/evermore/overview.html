    Evermore is designed to be map-centric. Using it is a two-step process.
    <ol>
      <li>Select one or more locations.
          <br>
	  This can be done by tapping on the map,
          providing an address or selecting from your device's contacts. The
          resulting locations are represented on the map by colored pins called
          <i>Targets</i>. The translucent circle that appears around the <i>Target</i>
          represents the radius of the searches to be done.  
      <li>Run one or more searches.
          <br>
	  Searches are done by using the buttons on the
          left side of Evermore. Yelp searches or a search through the device's
          contacts can be done. The search results are represented on the map by
          colored pins called <i>Darts</i>. 
    </ol>
    The standard map movement functions work (e.g., press, hold and move to pan
    the map, double finger pinch to zoom in/out, quick double-tap to zoom in,
    press and rotate with two fingers to rotate the map, etc.).
