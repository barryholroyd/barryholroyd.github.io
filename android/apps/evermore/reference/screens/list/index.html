    The List screen helps you identify which Darts are ahead of you
    and which are behind you as you travel -- generally, most people
    don't want to backtrack to go to a particular restaurant or
    gas station.
    <p>
    The List screen displays all the <i>Darts</i> in a list format.  The
    nearest <i>Darts</i> will be near the center of the list and the furthest
    <i>Darts</i> will be at the top and bottom of the list. By default, the
    top of the list represents North but if you are moving then it will match
    the direction of your most recent movement.
    <p>
    Each row has the following, from left to right.
    <ul>
      <li>An icon representing the type of the row (e.g., <i>Contact</i>, <i>Yelp Search</i>).
      <li>Short description of the <i>Dart</i>.
      <li>Line-of-sight distance to the represented <i>Dart</i>.
      <li>Arrow pointing in the direction of the <i>Dart</i>.
    </ul>
    Note that the distance provided is the <i>line-of-sight</i> distance to the
    <i>Dart</i> and may not be the same as the driving distance to the <i>Dart</i>.
