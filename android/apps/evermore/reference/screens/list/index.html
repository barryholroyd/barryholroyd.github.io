      <div class="margin200">
        The List screen helps you identify which
        <a href="/android/apps/evermore/terminology.html#Dart"><i>Darts</i></a>
        are ahead of you and which are behind you as you travel -- generally,
        most people don't want to backtrack to go to a particular restaurant or
        gas station.

        <h2 id="Concepts">Concepts</h2>
        There are two central concepts intrinsic to the List screen.
        <div class="margin50">
            <dl>
              <dt>Location</dt>
              <dd>This is your current location. When your device has access to its
                  location information, the location LED in the status bar will be
	          green. During those times when it cannot get a fix on its current
	          location, it will be red.</dd>
              <dt>Bearing</dt>
              <dd>This is the direction your device (and generally you) is
	          moving. It is <i>not</i> necessarily the direction the
		  device is facing.  When the device can get its bearing, the
		  bearing LED will be green; otherwise, it will be red. It
		  can sometimes be hard for a device to get its bearing --
		  your bearing LED may often be red when your location LED is
		  green.
            </dl>
          </div>
          In call cases, Evermore will do its best to provide both
	  location-based information (such as your distance from each Dart)
	  and bearing-based information (such as the direction to each Dart).
    <p>
    Location- and bearing-dependent items will slowly fade once their respective LED turns red. This is to indicate that Evermore is giving you the best information it can, but the information is slowly aging.
    <h2 id="ListStatusBar">List Status Bar</h2>
    At the top is the List Status Bar. It has the following items.
    <div class="margin50">
      <dl>
        <dt>Corner Arrows</dt>
        <dd>The two corner arrows indicate your bearing.</dd>
        <dt>Lock Button</dt>
        <dd>The Lock button will "lock" the list such that most of the items
            ahead of you and to the side of you appear on the screen; there
	    will be few items behind you which appear there.</dd>
        <dt>Center Direction</dt>
        <dd>Your current bearing will be shown in text in the center of the
            status bar. The two arrows to either side of it always point up.</dd>
        <dt>Location Led</dt>
        <dd>Indicates that your device has access to information about your
            current location.</dd>
        <dt>Bearing Led</dt>
        <dd>Indicates that your device has an understanding of the direction
            it is travelling.</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
    <h2 id="ListTable">List Table</h2>
    The List table displays all the <i>Darts</i> in a list format.  The
    nearest <i>Darts</i> will be near the center of the list and the furthest
    <i>Darts</i> will be at the top and bottom of the list. By default, the
    top of the list represents North but if you are moving then it will match
    the direction of your most recent movement.
    <p>
    Each row has the following, from left to right.
    <div style="margin-left:20; margin-right:20">
    <ul>
      <li>An icon representing the type of the row (e.g., <i>Contact</i>, <i>Yelp Search</i>).
      <li>Short description of the <i>Dart</i>.
      <li>Line-of-sight distance to the represented <i>Dart</i>.
      <li>Arrow pointing in the direction of the <i>Dart</i>.
    </ul>
    </div>
    Note that the distance provided is the <i>line-of-sight</i> distance to the
    <i>Dart</i> and may not be the same as the driving distance to the <i>Dart</i>.
