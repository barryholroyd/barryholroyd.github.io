    <h2 id="TheMap">The Map</h2>
    The Map is the center piece of Evermore. You can add
    <a href="../../../terminology.html#Target"><i>Targets</i></a>
    by simply tapping on the map.
    <p>
    Once one or more <i>Targets</i> are present, you can add
    <a href="../../../terminology.html#Dart"><i>Darts</i></a>
    by either doing a Contacts search (click on the Contacts
    button) or doing one or more Yelp searches (by clicking on the
    <i>Search</i> buttons).
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tap on an empty location to drop a <i>Target</i> there.
      <li>Tap on a <i>Target</i> to see its title.
      <li>Tap on a Contact <i>Dart</i> to see Contact details, then click on
          the phone number or email address to phone or email the contact,
	  respectively.
      <li>Tap on a Yelp <i>Dart</i> to see details of that particular Yelp
          search result.
      <li>Tapping on any pin will cause two icons to be displayed in the
          lower left corner of the map. Clicking on the blue diamond will
	  show you details of the selected location. Clicking on the small
	  map icon will give you directions to the selected location. 
      <li>The standard map movement functions work (e.g., press, hold and
          move to pan the map, double finger pinch to zoom in/out, quick
	  double-tap to zoom in, press and rotate with two fingers to rotate
	  the map, etc.). Tapping on the small circle in the upper right
	  corned will center the map on your current location.
    </ul>
    <h2 id="TopButtonPanel">Top Button Panel (Targets)</h2>

      <dd>Search through your Contacts to create a <i>Target</i>.
      <dt>Address Search</dt>
      <dd>Use a specific address to create a <i>Target</i>.

    more of the following.
    <dl>
      <dt>Contacts</dt>
      <dd>Click on Contacts to create Contact <i>Darts</i>
          near the <i>Targets</i>.  This will scan your mobile device's
	  address book for Contacts with Home and/or Work addresses and
	  display them on the map. You can long-click on the Contact button
	  to display <i>all</i> of your Contacts, even if there are no

	  will clear all contact from the map.
      <dt>Search #</dt>
      <dd>Click on one of the <i>Search</i> buttons to create a <i>Dart</i>
          for a Yelp search. After completing a search, clicking on the
	  button again will allow you to edit and repeat the search or clear

	  monochrome in the Settings at the top right.
      <dt>Clear Map</dt>
      <dd>This will clear all pins from the map, but will leave the Home
	  and Work icons, if present. This fully destroys the <i>Targets</i>
	  and <i>Darts</i> so that a fresh set of each can be created.
