    The Map is the center piece of Evermore. You can add <i>Targets</i> by
    simply tapping on the map.
    <p>
    Once one or more <i>Targets</i> are present, you can add <i>Darts</i> by
    either doing a <i>Contacts</i> search (click on the <i>Contacts</i>
    button) or doing one or more Yelp searches (by clicking on the
    <i>Search</i> buttons).
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tap on an empty location to drop a <i>Target</i> there.
      <li>Tap on a <i>Target</i> to see its title.
      <li>Tap on a Contact <i>Dart</i> to see Contact details, then click on
          the phone number or email address to phone or email the contact,
	  respectively.
      <li>Tap on a Yelp <i>Dart</i> to see details of that particular Yelp
          search result.
      <li>Tapping on any pin will cause two icons to be displayed in the
          lower left corner of the map. Clicking on the Blue Diamond will
	  show you details of the selected location. Clicking on the small
	  map icon will give you directions to the selected location. 
      <li>The standard map movement functions work (e.g., press, hold and
          move to pan the map, double finger pinch to zoom in/out, quick
	  double-tap to zoom in, press and rotate with two fingers to rotate
	  the map, etc.). Tapping on the small circle in the upper right
	  corned will center the map on your current location.
