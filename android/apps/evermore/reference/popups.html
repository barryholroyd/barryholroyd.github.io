        <h2>Targets</h2>
        Clicking on a Target will bring up a small popup which will allow you
	to delete the Target from the screen. Any Darts related to the Target
	will remain. This currently only works for manual Targets (i.e.,
	Targets you have created by clicking on the map).

        <h2>Darts</h2>
        Clicking on a Dart will bring up a small popup with additional
	information about the Dart. The type of information depends on the
	type of search which created the Dart.
        <h3>Contact Darts</h3>
        Clicking on a contact Dart will bring up a small popup which will
	display the contact's name, along with either "Home" or "Work" to
	indicate the type of the address.
        <p class="center">
          <img class="size-medium" src="data/images/popup-4.png">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <img class="size-medium" src="data/images/popup-5.png">
        </p>
        Clicking on the popup itself will expand the popup to display more
	detailed information, such as the contact's phone numbers and
	addresses.  Clicking on a phone number will allow you to phone the
	contact. Clicking on an address will bring up a Google Map for that
	address.
        <h3>Yelp Darts</h3>
        Clicking on a Yelp Dart will bring up a small popup which will
	display the name of the business as well as its rating.
        <p class="center">
          <img class="size-medium" src="data/images/popup-6.png">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <img class="size-medium" src="data/images/popup-7.png">
        </p>
        Clicking on the popup itself will bring up additional information
	about the business. Clicking on "Yelp Page" will bring up the full
	Yelp page for the business. Clicking on "Directions" will bring up a
	Google Map to that business.
