      Clicking on <i>Targets</i> and <i>Pins</i> on the map will allow you
      to drill down on relevant information for them. All of the popup
      windows are described here.
      <p>
      However, the easiest way to understand these popup windows is to simply
      experiment a bit by clicking on various <i>Targets</i> and <i>Pins</i>,
      clicking on the small pop up windows that appear and then clicking on
      various fields in those windows (e.g., clicking on a phone number will
      bring up your device's phone app).

        <h2>Targets</h2>
        Clicking on a <i>Target</i> will bring up a small popup window with
	summary information about the <i>Target</i>.  Clicking on that popup
	will bring up a larger popup window that will allow you to delete the
	<i>Target</i> (any <i>Pins</i> related to the Target will remain) or
	just hide the <i>Target's</i> window.
