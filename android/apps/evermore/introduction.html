      Evermore is a search app with an emphasis on making results from
      multiple searches easily understandable by presenting them all on a
      single map. This map- centric approach is very visual: seeing exactly
      where your search results are relative to each other and to desired
      target locations makes them much easier to understand than a simple
      list of results, like many search apps provide. The ability to do multiple searches,
      as well as searches of different types (e.g., through Yelp and through
      your address book), and display all the results in an integrated fashion
      on a single map, is unique to Evermore.
      <p>
      In Evermore, the map isn't just a way to present information. The map is
      the heart of the app.  It is a container into which you can progressively
      add more and more information.
      <p>
      These features make Evermore ideally suited to planning trips, both
      long and short.
      <h2>Why Evermore?</h2>
      Evermore:
      <ul>
        <li>can do multiple types of searches (e.g., Yelp, address book).
        <li>can display the results of multiple searches at the same time on a single map.
        <li>can display all of the search results in a list with arrow pointing in the physical direction of each result.
      </ul>
      Evermore is also designed to provide an extremely intuitive interface for
      understanding and manipulating search results.
      <ul>
        <li>Results are color-coded.
        <li>The radii used to target search results are presented as translucent circles.
        <li>Searches can be easily refined and repeated.
        <li>You can drill-down on search results. For example, you can
            click on a Yelp search result to bring up the full Yelp page, or
	    click on the phone number of a contact to call them.
      </ul>
      <h2>Using Evermore is Easy</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Select one or more target locations by tapping on the map.
        <li>Click on Contacts to see all your contacts near the targets or
            click on Search to do a Yelp search near the targets.
      </ol>
      All the standard map movement functions work (e.g., press, hold and
      move to pan the map; double finger pinch to zoom in/out; quick
      double-tap to zoom in; press and rotate with two fingers to rotate the
      map; etc.). Tap on the small gray target icon in the upper right
      corner of the map to zoom the map in to your current location. In
      Settings (under the overflow menu -- the three dots in the upper right
      corner) you can find settings to toggle standard Google Map features
      such as traffic overlay, satellite view, etc.
      <p>
