    <h2 id="YelpAndGoogleMaps">How is this better/different than Yelp and
        Google Maps?</h2>
    Neither Yelp nor Google Maps:
      <ol>
        <li>provide targets to center your searches on.
        <li>allow you to do multiple simultaneous searches.
        <li>allow you to do searches of multiple types.
        <li>support searches through your address book.
        <li>provide a list of results with a color-coded arrow pointing in the
            physical direction of each result.	
        <li>show search results in a number of <i>targetted</i> areas.
      </ol>
    <h2 id="Contacts">What are Contacts?</h2>
    Contacts are addresses pulled from your device's address book and displayed
    on the map as home and work addresses.
    <p>
    Contacts get loaded the first time the app is run after installation. 
    While this is happening, a progress bar is displayed in the lower left
    portion of the screen. Small messages indicating the start and end of
    the loading process will also appear briefly at the bottom of the screen.
    <p>
    After this initial load, the Contacts will be silently refreshed each
    time the app is started. Because this can take some time, but typically
    results in only small changes in the list of loaded Contacts, no progress
    bar is shown.
    <p>
    The display of a Contact on the map in Evermore depends on the Contact
    having a postal address (home and/or work) and that any such addresses
    can be mapped to a latitude and longitude. If an address is missing or
    mal-formed or if Google's Geocoder can't locate it, then it won't be
    displayed on the map.
    <h2 id="Bearings">Why can't I get a bearing on the List screen?</h2>
    Devices generally can obtain a <a href="terminology.html#Location">location</a> much more easily
    than a <a href="terminology.html#Bearing">bearing</a>. When location information is
    obtained by the device, by definition it always contains the location. It may or may
    not include bearing information. The device has to determine if it is moving and,
    if so, in which direction. The implementation of this appears to vary greatly by
    manufacturer. In all cases, Android apps simply need to wait for the information
    to be provided. When displaying the List screen (where location and bearing are most
    relevant), Evermore attempts to keep you as informed as possible regarding the status
    of both location and bearing information via two mechanisms.
    <ol>
      <dl>
        <dt>LEDs
	<dd>At the top of the List screen are two leds -- one for location
	    and one for bearing. By default, they are red, indicating that no
	    current location/bearing information is available. They turn
	    green when the information becomes available.  Because bearing
	    information is a subset of the overall location information, the
	    location LED will always turn green before the bearing LED.
	    Because bearing information can be difficult to obtain, you may
	    find that the bearing LED remains red long after the location LED
	    has turned green.
	<dt>Dimming
	<dd>Each row on the List screen has the distance to the Dart (search
	    result) at the right end of the row, followed by an arrow
	    pointing in the physical direction of the Dart. When a location
	    or bearing signal is lost, the LED will immediately turn red.
	    Evermore will continue to present the latest information
	    available (distance and direction of each Dart). However, the
	    distance text will slowly fade over time after the location LED
	    has turned red, to indicate that the information is getting
	    stale. Similarly, the colored arrows at the end of the rows will
	    slowly fade after the bearing LED turns red.
      </dl>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="OverlappingSearches">Why do I see multiple Darts for a single search result?</h2>
    If there are multiple Targets on the map with overlapping radii, then a
    search may have multiple Darts appear at the same location -- one for
    each of the radii. This is by design. You have the option of clearing a
    search -- with this approach, an appropriate number of Darts will still
    be present at each location.
    <p>
    <h2 id="Futures">What new features are in the works for Evermore?</h2>
    Evermore is highly expandable. Because it is map-driven and
    search-agnostic, over time more and more services and features can be added.
    For instance:
    <ol>
      <li>Long tap on the map to produce a pop-up showing the current local
          time at that location as well as a short weather synopsis.
      <li>Save specific configurations of targets and searches so that you
          can plot out a trip and then call up that configuration later.
    </ol>
