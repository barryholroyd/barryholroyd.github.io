        <h2 id="YelpAndGoogleMaps">How is Evermore better/different than Yelp
	    and Google Maps?</h2>
        Neither Yelp nor Google Maps:
          <ol>
            <li>allows you to do multiple types of searches.
            <li>allows you to do multiple simultaneous searches.
            <li>provides targets to center your searches on.
            <li>supports searches through your address book.
            <li>provides a list of results with color-coded arrows
	        pointing towards each of the search results.
          </ol>

        <h2 id="Contacts">What are Contacts?</h2>
            Contacts are addresses pulled from your device's address book and
	    displayed on the map as home and work addresses.
        <p>
        Contacts get loaded the first time the app is run after
	installation.  While this is happening, a progress bar is displayed
	in the lower left portion of the screen. Small messages indicating
	the start and end of the loading process will also appear briefly at
	the bottom of the screen.
        <p>
        After the initial load, your Contacts will be silently refreshed each
	time the app is started. Because this can take some time, but
	typically results in only small changes in the list of loaded
	Contacts, no progress bar is shown.
        <p>
	For a Contact to be loaded into Evermore:
	<ol>
	  1. It must be in your device's address book.
	  2. It must have a valid home and/or work postal address.
	  3. Google's geocoder server must be able to translate it
	    to a latitude/longitude pair.
	</ol>

	<h2 id="GeocoderFails">Evermore Won't Recognize a Valid Address</h2>
	In some cases, an address may be valid yet Evermore won't recognize
	it. Evermore uses Google's geocoder and, for some reason, the
	geocoder doesn't always recognize valid addresses. The workaround for
	this is to change the address slightly -- e.g., increment the address
	by 1. Although that is less than ideal, it is often sufficient for
	the geocoder to recognize the address.

        <h2 id="Bearings">Why can't I get a bearing on the List screen?</h2>
        Devices can generally obtain a <a
	href="terminology.html#Location">location</a>
	much more easily than a
	<a href="terminology.html#Bearing">bearing</a>. When location
	information is obtained by the device, it always contains a latitude
	and longitude (the location itself) and it <i>may</i> contain bearing
	information. In order to provide bearing information, the device has
	to determine if it is moving and, if so, in which direction. The
	implementation of this appears to vary greatly by manufacturer. In
	all cases, Android apps simply need to wait for the information to be
	provided. When displaying the List screen (where location and bearing
	are most relevant), Evermore attempts to keep you as informed as
	possible regarding the status of both location and bearing
	information via two mechanisms.
        <ol>
          <dl>
            <dt>LEDs
            <dd>At the top of the List screen are two leds -- one for
	        location and one for bearing. By default, they are red,
		indicating that no current location/bearing information is
		available. They turn green when the information becomes
		available.  Because bearing information is a subset of the
		overall location information, the location LED will always
		turn green before the bearing LED.  Because bearing
		information can be difficult to obtain, you may find that the
		bearing LED remains red long after the location LED has
		turned green.
            <dt>Dimming
            <dd>Each row on the List screen has the distance to the
		href="terminology.html#Pin">Pin</a>
	        (search result) at the right end of the row, followed by an
		arrow pointing in the physical direction of the <i>Pin</i>. When a
		location or bearing signal is lost, the LED will immediately
		turn red.  Evermore will continue to present the latest
		information available (distance and direction of each <i>Pin</i>).
		However, the distance text will slowly fade over time after
		the location LED has turned red, to indicate that the
		information is getting stale. Similarly, the colored arrows
		at the end of the rows will slowly fade after the bearing LED
		turns red.
          </dl>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="OverlappingSearches">Why do I see multiple <i>Pins</i> for a
	    single search result?</h2>
        If there are multiple <i>Targets</i> on the map with overlapping
	radii, then a search may have multiple <i>Pins</i> appear at the
	same location -- one for each of the radii. This is by design. You
	have the option of clearing a search -- with this approach, an
	appropriate number of <i>Pins</i> will still be present at each
	location.

        <h2 id="Futures">What new features are in the works for Evermore?</h2>
        Evermore is highly expandable. Because it is map-driven and
	search-agnostic, over time more and more services and features can be
	added.  For instance:
        <ol>
          <li>Long tap on the map to produce a pop-up showing the current
	      local time at that location as well as a short weather synopsis.
          <li>Save specific configurations of targets and searches so that
	      you can plot out a trip and then call up that configuration later.
        </ol>

	<!-- YELP -->
        <h2 id="YelpNoSearchResults">When I do a Yelp search Evermore doesn't
	    find anything.</h2>
	There are several reasons that an Evermore search may fail. In each
	case, it should give you a reasonable explanation of why the search
	failed, although sometimes the failure might still be perplexing.
	Here are some common causes.
	<ol>
	  <li>Many Yelp searches actually do yield no results, in which case
	      a short pop up window will tell you that nothing was found.
	      Also, the small led for the search will be lit only if
	      something is found.
	  <li>Be sure that you have a <i>Target</i> on the map. Evermore will
	      not do a search without a <i>Target</i> present.
	  <li>Be sure that the <i>Target</i> is visible. If you are looking
	      at a portion of the map which doesn't have any <i>Targets</i>
	      displayed, you won't be able to see the results of the search.
	  <li>If you have multiple <i>Targets</i> then you'll want to check
	      each of them to see if results appeared there. The easiest way
	      to do this is to expand the map to display all the
	      <i>Targets</i> and re-run the search, if necessary. You may
	      want to use the Map screen to do this (click on the Map radio
	      button as the top of the screen) -- that gives you the most
	      surface area for the map to be displayed.
	</ol>

        <h2 id="YelpSearchExceedsRadius">Yelp search exceeds radius</h2>
        Yelp searches sometimes return items that are outside of the specified
	radius. For example, you might specify a radius of two miles yet a
	search returns something that is four or five miles away. This is
	a quirk of Yelp -- Evermore simply displays whatever Yelp returns.

        <h2 id="YelpPriceFilter">Can I filter Yelp searches by price?</h2>
	Yelp searches (e.g., for restaurants) cannot be filtered by price
	(the Yelp API doesn't provide that capability).

        <h2 id="YelpRatingsFilter">Can I filter Yelp searches by rating?</h2>
	When doing a Yelp search in Evermore, you can specify a rating as a
	filter. Although the Yelp API doesn't provide that capability directly,
	the returned results do include ratings, so if
	you specify a rating in Evermore it will first collect all results
	without specifying a rating, and then apply the rating filter itself and
	return only those results with the specified rating or higher.
	<p>This has one subtle side effect which may be unexpected. The final
	result set might have fewer results than the maximum allowed, even
	though there are valid results that aren't included.
	<p>This can happen when Evermore initially collects the maximum number
	of possible results without the ratings filter, then ends up with fewer
	than the maximum after applying the filter. When this happens, you will
	get a short pop up notice indicating that the maximum number was found
	initially, but the total result set returned was smaller due to the
	filtering.
