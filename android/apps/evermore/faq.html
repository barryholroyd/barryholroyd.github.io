    <h2 id="Contacts">Contacts</h2>
    Contacts get loaded the first time the app is run after installation. 
    While this is happening, a progress bar is displayed under the Contacts
    button. Small messages indicating the start and end of the loading
    process will also appear briefly at the bottom of the screen.
    <p>
    After this initial load, the Contacts will be silently refreshed each
    time the app is started. Because this can take some time, but typically
    results in only a small change in the list of Contacts, if any, no
    progress bar is shown.
    <p>
    The display of a Contact on the map in Evermore depends on the Contact
    having a postal address (home and/or work) and that any such addresses
    can be mapped to a latitude and longitude.
    <p>
    If an address is missing or mal-formed or if Google's Geocoder can't
    locate it, then it won't be displayed on the map.

    <h2 id="OverlappingSearches">Overlapping Searches</h2>
    If there are multiple Targets on the map with overlapping radii, then a
    search may have multiple Darts appear at the same location -- one for
    each of the radii. This is by design. You have the option of clearing a
    search -- with this approach, an appropriate number of Darts will still
    be present at each location.
    <p>
    <h2 id="Futures">Futures</h2>
    Evermore is highly expandable. Because it is map-driven and
    search-agnostic, over time more and more services and features can be added.
    For instance:
    <ol>
      <li>Long tap on the map to produce a pop-up showing the current local time at that location as well as a short weather synopsis.
      <li>Save specific configurations of targets and searches so that you can plot out a trip and then call up that configuration later.
    </ol>
