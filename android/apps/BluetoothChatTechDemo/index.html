            <i>Bluetooth Chat Demo</i>
	    is a thorough Bluetooth implementation of a basic chat application.
	    <p>
	      The app should be run on two separate devices.  When started,
	      it will display two lists: one for discovered devices and one
	      for paired devices. Clicking on an entry in either list will
	      cause the app to attempt to connect to that remote device.  If
	      the remote device is running this app, the connection will
	      succeed and both devices will then display the chat UI and text
	      can be sent and received. Clicking on "Done" on either device
	      will terminate the session and both devices will return to the
	      original screen.
	    <p>
	      <i>Bluetooth Chat Demo</i> is rock solid. It handles all
	      network activity (connection set up as well as chat
	      communications) on background threads. Activities and threads
	      are managed carefully, with no memory or thread leaks. Displays
	      are maintained across device rotations, as are chat connections
	      (even the official Android Bluetooth chat demo loses its chat
	      connection when the device is rotated).
	    <p>
	      The full set of source code as well as complete technical
	      documentation are both available via the links below.
