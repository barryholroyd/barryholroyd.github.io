        <i>Bluetooth Chat Demo</i> demonstrates Bluetooth functionality in
	the form of a basic chat application.
	<p>
	  The app should be run on two separate devices.  When started, it
	  will display two lists: one for discovered devices and one for
	  paired devices. Clicking on an entry in either list will cause the
	  app to attempt to connect to that remote device.  If the remote
	  device is running this app, the connection will succeed and both
	  devices will then display the chat UI and text can be sent and
	  received. Clicking on "Done" on either device will terminate the
	  session and both devices will return to the original screen.
